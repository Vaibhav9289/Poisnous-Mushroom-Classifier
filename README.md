# Poisnous-Mushroom-Classifier

  > Developed a mushroom classifier model using Python and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms.

  > Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and patterns.

  > Prepared and transformed the dataset for machine learning by cleaning and encoding the data.

  > Experimented with different SVM kernels, including polynomial and linear kernels.

  > Achieved 100% accuracy in classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous using 20 features.
